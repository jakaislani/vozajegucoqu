<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Jaylen Brown</strong>, a two-time NBA All-Star has been a key player in Boston Celtics since the onset of his NBA career in 2016. Jaylen landed a spot in Celtics with the third overall pick after his successful collegiate career in University of California, Berkeley. Born on October 24, 1996, in Atlanta, Georgia, Brown isn't just another superstar athlete, the Celtics player, as everyone would agree, is a peculiar NBA star. &nbsp;</p><p>Since joining the NBA in 2016, Brown displayed his diverse range of interests and even advocated for a number of causes, including importance of education and technology, vegetarianism, and with his latest venture, his apparel brand 7uice, Brown aims to tackle market inequality and mass consumerism. &nbsp;</p><h2>Is Jaylen Brown Married? &nbsp;</h2><p>An NBA athlete who is an ardent activist and has other hobbies unlike most NBA players, typically known for gawking and flinging around with skanky supermodels. In addition, Brown made a record last year by signing the richest deal in NBA history- a <i>$304 million </i>extension with Celtics. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/8/395942540_1079388360139322_4518236752148731055_n%20(1)-1704738903724.jpg><p>One can only imagine Brown's demand in the celebrity dating pool, but is the Atlanta native available in the market or already taken? Deemed "too smart" to be an NBA player, Brown certainly lives by the image he has cemented. &nbsp;</p><p>Throughout his seven years of career, the two-time All-Star has shared almost nothing about his love life. Sure, rumor mills have spun their hoax magic sometimes, alleging that the young athlete has married secretly, but Jaylen, who turned 27 last year, is too focused on many ambitions to delve into marriage this early. &nbsp;</p><h2>Is Jaylen Brown Dating Anyone? &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Brown is yet to make it official, but the Celtics star player is seemingly in a committed relationship. Brown's name has been linked to a woman since September 2022 after the duo was spotted dancing in a New York pub. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/8/Snapinsta.app_10844042_738664352881539_1504621737_n_1080%20(1)-1704738816701.jpg><p>The lucky woman who allegedly holds a special place in Brown's is none other than <strong>Bernice Burgos</strong>, an Instagram influencer who has been referred to as Brown's secret fianc√©, and wife. Jaylen and Burgos are certainly not married and nor are they just fooling around. &nbsp;</p><p>After their little 2022 pub bonding sparked massive interest amongst fans, Jaylen and Bernice have noticeably gone lowkey. The rumored couple's last appearance that hinted at their romantic connection was back in February 2023 when the two were pictured getting cozy on a beach. &nbsp;</p><h3>Meet Jaylen Brown's Rumored Girlfriend, Bernice Burgos! &nbsp;</h3><p>The first thing that fans find baffling about Jaylen and Bernice is their age gap. While Brown is still in his 20s, his alleged girlfriend, Bernice, is reportedly in her 40s. Several sources have<a href=#> revealed </a>that Burgos, born in 1980, turned 43 last year. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/8/Snapinsta.app_346244855_160426050327419_7080061696286876064_n_1080%20(1)-1704739050215.jpg><p>Not only that, the Instagram influencer, who boasts a whopping 7 million followers on Instagram, is also a mother and a grandmother. Bernice has two daughters, <strong>Ashley Marie Burgos,</strong> and <strong>Sarai Burgos</strong>, from her previous relationships. &nbsp;</p><p>Bernice was apparently only 15 when she welcomed Ashley, who gave birth to a kid in 2018, making Burgos a young and hot granny. Burgos' shocking age gap with her alleged NBA beau isn't all there's to know about her. She is also a successful businesswoman and a recurring face on music videos. &nbsp;</p><p>Besides being a Fashion Nova ambassador, Burgos runs her own brand, Bold and Beautiful, which she has been overseeing as a CEO. She has appeared in several music videos of artists like <strong>DJ Khaled, J. Cole, Rick Ross, </strong>and <strong>Drake,</strong> with whom she was briefly linked in 2015.&nbsp;</p><h3>More on Jaylen Brown's Discreet Love Life! &nbsp;</h3><p>So far, we've established the fact that Brown is notoriously private about his love life. The Celtics star player not denying or admitting to his rumored romance with Burgos seems to confirm the long-swirling rumors. Although Brown has never dated anyone publicly, let alone getting candid about his personal life, Bernice is certainly not the first woman he has been linked with. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/8/Snapinsta.app_65119441_146165826555946_1731094339083636791_n_1080%20(1)-1704738831400.jpg><p>The two-time All-Star NBA player sparked dating rumors with model and influencer<strong> Jacqueline Hawileh</strong>, in 2021. A slew of pictures showing Jaylen and Hawileh enjoying a nice vacation during the All-star break were divulged, and soon, the internet was rife with gossips of the new love birds over the blurry snaps. &nbsp;</p><p>The rumor died down after neither party addressed the speculation and not long after, the Celtics player found himself being linked with singer <strong>H.E.R</strong>, another wild dating rumor which withered after being left unanswered. &nbsp;</p><p>Brown previously made a statement which seemed to his hinting at his reluctance to dive into a serious relationship while his career is skyrocketing. &nbsp;</p><p>"When [players] enter the league, the focus should be on what I call 'your main girlfriend,' and that should be basketball," <a href=#>said </a>the NBA star. Brown added, "There's an African proverb that says if you try to chase two hares at once, you'll mess around and lose both." &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqrrdilnKdlkqe8uLqMnZitoZ6ceqW10pymr52iYsGpsYycnKWsmZjAbr%2FEp6qarJmku7R5z56prKeelrluuMifnA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jaylen-brown-dating-discover-the-celtics-sensations-personal-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-jaylen-brown-dating-discover-the-celtics-sensations-personal-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jaylen-brown-dating-discover-the-celtics-sensations-personal-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-jaylen-brown-dating-discover-the-celtics-sensations-personal-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jaylen-brown-dating-discover-the-celtics-sensations-personal-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jaylen-brown-dating-discover-the-celtics-sensations-personal-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alicia-hollowell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alicia-hollowell.html>Alicia Hollowell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-popularmmos-where-patrick-julianelle-is-now-explained.html>What happened to popularmmos?
