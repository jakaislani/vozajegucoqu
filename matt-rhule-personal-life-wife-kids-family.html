The Carolina Panthers hired him as their head coach on 8 January 2020 with huge fortunes making him the sixth-highest paid football coach.<br></span></p><p><span>Matt, the father of three children, has his wife and family members as his back to lift his career without any doubt.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span><strong>Matt's Personal Life Insight: Embraced With A Supportive Wife</strong></span></h2><p><span>Matt Rhule's wife Julie Rhule has&nbsp;certainly backed him up when it comes to his professional NFL career.&nbsp;</span><span>It comes with no surprise that his better half Julie has&nbsp;played a vital role in Matt's career and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his new contract with the Panthers</a>.</span></p><p><span>Julie, who serves at the&nbsp;university as a registered dietitian, encouraged Matt to join as the fifth coach of Carolina Panthers in the National Football League (NFL).</span><span>&nbsp;She listened to her husband chatting with the Panther's Brass in Waco and pushed an effort to make the right choice. She said:</span></p><p><span><strong>"What are you doing? You need to go work for them. That’s you."</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>"This is your dream. You want to be in the NFL. These are people that I know you will jive with. You’ll do great things.’ I’m one of those people who go off gut reactions, and I knew it was right."</strong></span></p><p><span>Along with the enthralling personal life, Julie has the role of not only a wife but also a counselor to Matt. She looks forward to her husband being acknowledged by the Carolina Panthers' fans.</span></p><p><span>Despite all that support and understandings between the couple, they still maintain privacy regarding their married life.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Matt Is The Father Of Three&nbsp;Kids</strong></span></h2><p><span>Matt is not only a faithful husband but also a responsible father. He&nbsp;and his wife, Julie Rhule, are the parents to three kids.</span></p><p><span>They got blessed with their first child, Bryant, in 2004. The pair welcomed two other kids, namely, Vivienne and Leona.&nbsp;His&nbsp;15-year-old son Bryant also stood for the choice made by his father as&nbsp;a head football coach of&nbsp;Carolina Panthers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/Sports/matt-rhule-family.jpg alt width=650 height=343 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><strong><span>Matt Rhule with his wife, Julie, and&nbsp;their three kids (©: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">panthers.com</a>)</span></strong></p><p><span>The&nbsp;family of three lived in&nbsp;their Waco, Texas, house before moving to North Carolina in January 2020.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Family Is&nbsp;Always His Inspiration</strong></span></h2><p><span>Matt Rhule has supportive parents, as well. He is the son of Denny Rhule and Gloria Rhule, who grew up with his sister named Dana in his family. Matt, along with his dad and mom, moved to New York City from Kansas City in 1980, where Matt's father Denny started coaching at the high school.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Denny's history also excavates his coaching career at several&nbsp;sports, including football, softball,&nbsp;baseball, soccer, and basketball at high school. He has been a vital person in Matt's coaching career as Matt seeks many inspirations to deal with the players on a personal level.</span></p><p><span><strong>Know His Professional NFL Career:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Panthers Elected Matt Rhule As The New Coach Offering New Contract And Salary</a></strong></span></p><p><span>His father, Denny Rhule, who is a Nazarene&nbsp;minister, always&nbsp;pushed him into a positive path teaching him that an accessible route is not still best. As a football coach, Matt instituted himself as a disciple and accepted the challenge, as his parents taught him.</span></p><p><span>After Matt joined Baylor University as a head coach, Denny and Gloria accompanied him in Waco, where Denny voluntarily led Bible studies with staff and other players.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunC%2Fz6ipratfoq61wIyrn66klWK9pr7SqKWapF2htqexjLCgn51doLalv4yfmKahnK4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-rhule-personal-life-wife-kids-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatt-rhule-personal-life-wife-kids-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatt-rhule-personal-life-wife-kids-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatt-rhule-personal-life-wife-kids-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-rhule-personal-life-wife-kids-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-rhule-personal-life-wife-kids-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./farrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./farrah-fawcett-quit-charlies-angels.html>Why Farrah Fawcett Quit Charlies Angels After One Season</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./josh-harder-bio-age-family-wife-election-results-denham-and-net-worth-2.html>Josh Harder Bio, Age, Family, Wife, Election, Results, Denham, and Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./josh-harder-bio-age-family-wife-election-results-denham-and-net-worth-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
