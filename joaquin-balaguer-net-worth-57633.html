Balaguer, a renowned political figure in the Dominican Republic, served as the country's President for multiple terms.

Balaguer's legacy in Dominican politics continues to be remembered, and his net worth reflects a lifetime of public service rather than accumulating significant personal wealth.</p><h2>Some Joaquin Balaguer images</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/33/joaquin-balaguer-0.jpg alt="Joaquin Balaguer" title="Joaquin Balaguer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/33/joaquin-balaguer-1.jpg alt="Joaquin Balaguer" title="Joaquin Balaguer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/33/joaquin-balaguer-2.jpg alt="Joaquin Balaguer" title="Joaquin Balaguer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1906</span><p>Balaguer was born on 1 September 1906 in Villa Bison√≥ (also known as Navarrete), Santiago Province in the northwestern corner of the <a href=#>Dominican</a> Republic. His father was Joaqu√≠n Jes√∫s Balaguer Lespier, a Puerto Rican native of Catalan and <a href=#>French</a> ancestry, and his mother was Carmen Celia Ricardo Heureaux, daughter of Manuel de Jesus Ricardo and Rosa Amelia Heureaux (of <a href=#>French</a> descent), who was also a cousin of <a href=#>President</a> Ulises Heureaux. Balaguer was the only son in a family of several daughters.</p><span>1950</span><p>For the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing in the Americas and the visit of Pope John Paul II, Balaguer spent millions on a restoration of parts of historic, colonial Santo Domingo, and on sprucing up the parts of the city to be transversed by the pope, including the construction of a grand new avenue lined with modern housing blocks.</p><span>1957</span><p>When Trujillo arranged to have his brother H√©ctor re-elected to the presidency in 1957, he chose Balaguer as vice-president. Three years later, when pressure from the Organization of <a href=#>American</a> States (OAS) convinced the dictator that it was inappropriate to have a member of his family as <a href=#>President</a>, Trujillo forced his brother to resign, and Balaguer succeeded to the post.</p><span>1961</span><p>The situation was dramatically altered, however, when Trujillo was assassinated in May 1961. Trujillo's son, Ramfis, initially inherited power with Balaguer as his puppet. They initially took steps to liberalize the regime, granting some civil liberties and easing Trujillo's tight censorship of the press. Meanwhile, he revoked the nonaggression pact made with Cuba in January 1961. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a populace who had no memory of the instability and poverty that preceded Trujillo, and wanted more freedom and a more equitable distribution of wealth. At the same time, Ramfis' reforms went too far for the hard-line <i>trujillistas</i> led by his own uncles, H√©ctor and Jos√© Arismendi Trujillo. As the OAS continued economic sanctions imposed for Trujillo's attempted murder of <a href=#>Venezuelan</a> <a href=#>President</a> Romulo Betancourt, Ramfis warned that the country could descend into civil war between left and right.</p><span>1964</span><p>The Union Civica Nacional (UCN) called a national strike and demanded the formation of a provisional government under their leader, Viriato Fiallo, with elections to be delayed until 1964. The military were vehemently against the UCN taking power and Echaverr√≠a proposed a continuation of the Balaguer regime until the elections. The <a href=#>American</a> consul mediated between the two sides and in January 1962 final agreement led to the creation of a seven-member Council of State, led by Balaguer but including members of the UCN, to replace both the <a href=#>Dominican</a> Congress and the <a href=#>President</a> and his cabinet until the election. The OAS finally lifted sanctions against the country upon the formation of the council. However, popular unrest against Balaguer continued and many saw Echaverr√≠a as positioning himself to seize power. Military forces opened fire on demonstrators on 14 January which led to rioting the following day. On 16 January, Balaguer resigned and Echaverr√≠a staged a military coup d'√©tat and arrested the other member of the council. With the US supporting the UCN and a new national strike beginning immediately, Echaverr√≠a was arrested by other officers two days later. The Council of State was restored under the leadership of Rafael Bonnelly and Balaguer went into exile in New York and Puerto Rico.</p><span>1965</span><p>Balaguer found a nation severely beaten by decades of turbulence, with few short times of peace, and virtually ignorant of democracy and human rights. He sought to pacify the enmities surviving from the Trujillo regime and from the 1965 civil war, but political murders continued to be frequent during his administration. He succeeded in partially rehabilitating the public finances, which were in a chaotic state, and pushed through a modest program of economic development. He was easily reelected in 1970 against fragmented opposition and won again in 1974 after changing the voting rules in a way that led the opposition to boycott the race.</p><span>1966</span><p>Ronald Reagan once said of him "President Balaguer has been a driving force throughout his country's democratic development. In 1966 he led democracy's return to the <a href=#>Dominican</a> Republic after years of political uncertainty and turmoil. Indeed, he is, in many ways, the father of <a href=#>Dominican</a> democracy" and Jimmy Carter complimented him saying "President Balaguer has set an <a href=#>Example</a> for all <a href=#>Leaders</a> in this nation in changing his own country and his own people away from a former totalitarian government to one of increasingly pure democracy."</p><span>1978</span><p>In 1978 Balaguer sought another term. However, by this time, inflation was on the rise, and the great majority of the people had gotten little benefit from the economic boom of the past decade. Balaguer faced Antonio Guzm√°n, a wealthy rancher running under the banner of the <a href=#>Dominican</a> Revolutionary Party. When election returns showed an unmistakable trend in Guzm√°n's favor, the military stopped the count. However, amid vigorous protests at home and strong pressure abroad, the count resumed. When the returns were all in, Guzm√°n handed Balaguer the first loss of his electoral career. When Balaguer left office that year, it marked the first time in the <a href=#>Dominican</a> Republic's history that an incumbent <a href=#>President</a> peacefully surrendered power to an elected member of the opposition.</p><span>1982</span><p>In the 1982 elections, the PRD's Salvador Jorge Blanco defeated Balaguer, who had merged his party with the Social <a href=#>Christian</a> Revolutionary Party to form the Social <a href=#>Christian</a> Reformist Party two years earlier.</p><span>1986</span><p>Balaguer ran again in the elections 1986, and took advantage of a split in the PRD and an unpopular austerity program to win the presidency again after an eight-year absence. By this time, he was 80 years old and almost completely blind (he had suffered from glaucoma for many years).</p><span>1990</span><p>Balaguer was narrowly reelected in the elections of 1990, defeating his old foe Juan Bosch by only 22,000 votes out of 1.9 million votes cast amid charges of fraud.</p><span>1992</span><p>More controversial was that Balaguer spent two hundred million US dollars on the construction of a massive ten-story Columbus Lighthouse. Completed in 1992, the Columbus Lighthouse was designed to beam the image of a <a href=#>Christian</a> cross into the night sky and to be visible for tens of miles. Since completion, the Columbus Lighthouse, which supposedly houses Columbus's remains, has been a minor tourist attraction. Its light has almost never been used due to extremely high <a href=#>Energy</a> costs and frequent blackouts in the country. However, its symbolism and expense were the source of much controversy.</p><span>1994</span><p>In the 1994 elections, Balaguer decided to run again for the presidency, even though he was almost 90 years old and completely blind. This time, his most prominent opponent was Jos√© Francisco Pe√±a of the PRD.</p><span>1996</span><p>In the 1996 elections, Balaguer's vice <a href=#>President</a>, Jacinto Peynado, finished well short of making it to the runoff. Balaguer then threw his support to the <a href=#>Dominican</a> Liberation Party's Leonel Fern√°ndez in an unusual coalition with Bosch, his political foe of over 30 years.</p><span>2000</span><p><br>In 2000, Balaguer sought the presidency yet again. He won around 23% of the votes in the election, with PLD candidate Danilo <a href=#>Medina</a> just barely nosing him out for a spot in the runoff with PRD candidate Hip√≥lito Mej√≠a. Balaguer hinted that his supporters might split their votes between Mej√≠a and <a href=#>Medina</a> in the runoff. <a href=#>Medina</a> would have needed nearly all of Balaguer's supporters to cross over to him in order to have any realistic chance of overcoming a 25-point deficit in the first round. When it was apparent <a href=#>Medina</a> would be lucky to get half of them, he pulled out of the runoff, handing the presidency to Mej√≠a.</p><span>2002</span><p>On July 14, 2002, Joaqu√≠n Balaguer died of heart failure at Santo Domingo's Abreu Clinic at the age of 95.</p><span>2019</span><p>Although official and unofficial repression of the opposition parties (the <a href=#>Dominican</a> Revolutionary Party and National Civic Union, as well as the communist <a href=#>Dominican</a> Popular Movement) continued, Balaguer publicly condemned this repression and in September he pledged to form a coalition government. Hector and Jose Trujillo left the country in October but the opposition parties demanded Ramfis withdraw from the government as well. At the end of October, Ramfis announced that he would resign if the OAS agreed to lift the economic sanctions. The OAS agreed on November 14 but Ramfis‚Äô uncles returned to the country the following day, hoping to lead a military coup. Ramfis resigned and went into exile on November 17 and rumours circulated that Air Force general <a href=#>Fernando</a> Arturo S√°nchez Otero would support pro-Castro <a href=#>Revolutionaries</a>. The United States now sent a small fleet of ships and 1,800 marines to patrol <a href=#>Dominican</a> waters. The US consul informed Balaguer that these forces stood ready to intervene at his request, and would be supported by forces from <a href=#>Venezuela</a> and <a href=#>Colombia</a>. Air Force general Pedro Rafael Ram√≥n Rodr√≠guez Echavarr√≠a announced his support for Balaguer and bombed pro-Trujillo forces. The Trujillo brothers again fled the country on November 20 and Echavarr√≠a became Secretary of Armed Forces.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1906 births</a> <a href=#>2002 deaths</a> <a href=#>People from Santiago Province (Dominican Republic)</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic people of Catalan descent</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic people of French descent</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic people of Puerto Rican descent</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic people of Spanish descent</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic anti-communists</a> <a href=#>Social Christian Reformist Party politicians</a> <a href=#>Presidents of the Dominican Republic</a> <a href=#>20th-century Dominican Republic poets</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic male poets</a> <a href=#>University of Paris alumni</a> <a href=#>Blind politicians</a> <a href=#>Politicians with physical disabilities</a> <a href=#>Vice Presidents of the Dominican Republic</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic novelists</a> <a href=#>Male novelists</a> <a href=#>Dominican Republic male writers</a> <a href=#>Ambassadors of the Dominican Republic to Colombia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeapK6ywcinZJuZnJa0trHRZqWerF2svLPAx2ZscG5jaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoaquin-balaguer-net-worth-57633.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoaquin-balaguer-net-worth-57633.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoaquin-balaguer-net-worth-57633.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoaquin-balaguer-net-worth-57633.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoaquin-balaguer-net-worth-57633.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoaquin-balaguer-net-worth-57633.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shay-mitchell-top-movies-tv-shows-and-awards.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shay-mitchell-top-movies-tv-shows-and-awards.html>Shay Mitchell top movies, TV shows and awards</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./new-guardians-galaxy-vol-2-album-cover-inspired-character-posters-revealed.html>New Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 Album Cover Inspired Character Posters Revealed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./new-guardians-galaxy-vol-2-album-cover-inspired-character-posters-revealed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
