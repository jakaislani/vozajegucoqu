But in the 2nd quarter, the Warriors bounced back and scored 35 points in the 2nd quarter.</p><p>As they entered the third quarter, the Warriors were up by 11 points but still, Stephen was not able to find the rhythm.</p><p>Curry didn’t drop in his first 3-pointer until there was 1:34 remaining in the third quarter.</p><p>But as he dropped the 3-pointer, he soon followed that with another 3-pointer on the next possession.</p><p>He started to pace up and scored 12 of his 33 points in the third and the Warriors took a 10-point lead into the fourth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hPVGg.GByqtAk7QTvW6Y0g--~B/aD00MzM7dz02NTA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/media.zenfs.com/en/cp.org/db461da3ec3a46df3d1467d5139b80a7><p>Ultimately, Steph finished the night dropping his ninth consecutive 30 plus point.</p><p>As he made 33 points to give the Warriors a 119-101 win over Cleveland.</p><h2>Strong plays from the Warriors’ bench.</h2><p>Even though the Warriors started slowly in the 1st quarter but they picked up the rhythm in the 2nd quarter dropping 35 points.</p><p>And gave the Warriors 11 point lead into the third quarter.</p><p>As <a href=#>Stephen Curry</a> was not able to heat up until the third quarter it was up to other players to make plays to give the Warriors the lead.</p><p>The Warriors’ bench was able to deliver at the knick of the time with Juan Toscano-Anderson’s career-high 20 points coming off the bench.</p><p>They helped the Warriors in the game until Curry was able to find his rhythm and close the game with 119-101 in Thursday win over Cleveland.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Four in a row</p><p>add another DUB to the win column ✔️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pbjbs4xuSy</a></p><p>— Golden State Warriors (@warriors) <a href=#>April 16, 2021</a></p><p>“That was really a good win for us,” head coach Steve Kerr said. “We just had to grind it out.</p><p>Our first four-game win streak of the year, we’re in a really good place right now mentally, spiritually.”</p><p>On the second night of a back-to-back following Wednesday night’s win in Oklahoma City, the Warriors’ bench support and great plays gave the Warriors their fourth straight win.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Golden State’s bench outscored Cleveland’s 1st quarter lead as Toscano-Anderson went 8-for-9 and added seven rebounds and three assists.</p><p>Jordan Poole had 14 points and four assists and Damion Lee finished with 11 points and five rebounds, all coming off the bench.</p>Starter <a href=#>Andrew Wiggins</a> also played well and helped the second unit that started the second and fourth quarters.<p>He eventually finished with 23 points, six rebounds, and six assists playing 34 minutes.</p><p>“We’re in a good rhythm, we’re playing together, the defense is coming along,” Wiggins said after helping hold Cleveland to 42.2% shooting. “I feel like that’s the main thing.”</p><h2>Juan Toscano-Anderson impressive game.</h2><p>While Curry’s scoring continues to impress everyone, another Warrior’s also not behind and continue to impress with their plays.</p><p>One of such Warrior is Juan Toscano-Anderson.

He was all over the ball in that second quarter defensively, which I thought kind of changed the tone of the game.”</p><p>Even though the Cavaliers (20-35) aren’t the strongest of opponents, but Golden State outscored and took the win on the second night of a back-to-back on the road.</p><p>With the win, the Warriors take sole possession of the No. 9 seed in the Western Conference.</p><p>And are within a half-game of Memphis for the No. 8 seed. Golden State is back to .500 for the first time since March 23.</p><p>“Whenever you got No. 30 on your team you’re a contender,” Toscano-Anderson said, “as long as everything else around him is clicking.</p><p>We’re stringing together some wins and I think if we can put ourselves in a position to compete for the playoffs.</p><p>I don’t think any team is looking at the playoff standings and saying “We want Golden State.”</p><p>With this win, the Warriors (28-28) have now won five of their last six going into Saturday’s game in Boston.</p><h2>Cleveland falls to the Warriors</h2><p>Even though Cleveland took the 1st quarter win over the GSW but soon fall to the Warriors’ bench.</p><p>They were not able to find the answer for the hot Warriors’ bench and soon lost their lead and eventually, the Warriors took 11 point lead at the end.</p><p><a href=#>Collin Sexton</a> dropped 30 points, while Darius Garland dropped 20 points and Jarett Allen made 17 points for Cleveland.</p><p>They will face Chicago Bulls on Sunday for the next game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2F056noZ2eYrC2vtGyZHKsmGLAtb7Aop6hrF2crq6x0mauoqyYYoBxec%2BooKeso2Kur7CMoKqwZWSptW6%2F06uYop%2BYqXq4tc1o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstephen-curry-9th-straight-games-with-30-points-and-gsw-4th-straight-win.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstephen-curry-9th-straight-games-with-30-points-and-gsw-4th-straight-win.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstephen-curry-9th-straight-games-with-30-points-and-gsw-4th-straight-win.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstephen-curry-9th-straight-games-with-30-points-and-gsw-4th-straight-win.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstephen-curry-9th-straight-games-with-30-points-and-gsw-4th-straight-win.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstephen-curry-9th-straight-games-with-30-points-and-gsw-4th-straight-win.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./8-things-you-didnt-know-about-tanishaa-mukerji.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./8-things-you-didnt-know-about-tanishaa-mukerji.html>8 Things You Didnt Know About Tanishaa Mukerji</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./samantha-lorraine.html>Samantha Lorraine movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./samantha-lorraine.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
