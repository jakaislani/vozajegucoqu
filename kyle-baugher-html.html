But supporting players&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Grimes</a>, Wes Bentley,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cole Hauser</a>, and Kelly Reilly have seen their star rise since the show’s debut.</p><p>For those that don’t know actor Kelly Reilly’s story, she is a veteran television and film performer who has made a name for herself portraying the unhinged Montana manipulator, Beth Dutton, on the series.</p><p>However, her British roots, marriage to Kyle Baugher, and their private life behind the scenes make her a standout among the rest of her cast members. So who is Kyle Baugher, and what is his life really like with Kelly Reilly?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kyle-baugher-is-a-financier-and-met-kelly-reilly-in-2012><strong>KYLE BAUGHER IS A FINANCIER AND MET KELLY REILLY IN 2012</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-pinterest wp-block-embed-pinterest"></figure><p>Unlike her character Beth Dutton on&nbsp;Yellowstone, actor Kelly Reilly is much more tight-lipped about her personal life. However, she met 45-year-old Kyle Baugher in 2012 and married him shortly thereafter. Baugher is a financier with a penchant for sporting a mustache most of the time and managing large amounts of money on behalf of others.</p><p>Kelly Reilly was previously engaged to Israeli actor Jonah Lotan in the mid-2000s. Lotan is mainly known to American audiences for playing Dr. Marty Pino on&nbsp;CSI: NY&nbsp;and Rudy McCoy on the second season of&nbsp;Homeland. They broke off their engagement in 2009, and Reilly chose to look for love outside of the entertainment business, which brought her to meet and marry Kyle Baugher.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kyle-baugher-and-kelly-reilly-live-in-new-york-and-do-not-have-any-children><strong>KYLE BAUGHER AND KELLY REILLY LIVE IN NEW YORK AND DO NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN</strong></h3><p>Kelly Reilly previously split her time between her native England and Los Angeles, where she resided for much of her early acting career. After meeting Kyle Baugher, the couple married in Somerset, England, in 2012, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>. They have since permanently moved to New York and have fallen in love with the vibrant nature surrounding The Empire State by growing a garden at their home.</p><p>Kelly Reilly is widely known for keeping a low profile outside of her acting roles and is incredibly private about her marriage and life with her husband, Kyle Baugher. Since Baugher is not involved in the entertainment industry and has yet to make plans to become an actor any time soon, Reilly tends not to mention him or his name in interviews she gives to reporters.</p><p>The two do not appear to have any children, nor have they spoken about having children in the future.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-is-not-on-social-media-but-kelly-reilly-is-on-instagram><strong>HE IS NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT KELLY REILLY IS ON INSTAGRAM</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-19-at-6.42.42-PM-900x607.png><p>Due to the nature of wanting their private life together to stay private, the low-profile marriage of Kyle Baugher and actor Kelly Reilly comprises of not having an active social media presence. Kyle Baugher does not have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or Twitter, while Reilly does have an Instagram account with 673,000 followers to date. However, don’t expect to see much of Baugher on it.</p><p>Kelly Reilly keeps up with her own Instagram account, seemingly to stay relevant by posting pictures of the set of&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;and letting fans of the television show comment on them.</p><p>Reilly has only recently included one photo with Kyle Baugher on her Instagram grid, complete with a caption that reads, “Another year of love..so grateful for you.”</p><p>Most of Reilly’s social media activity serves to promote&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;and images of her costars rather than her personal life with Kyle Baugher. Due to her character’s tough-as-nails demeanor and outlook on life, Reilly’s social media is the complete opposite of what you’d believe Beth Dutton to show off on Instagram.</p><p>Fans of Reilly’s are often treated to pictures of flowers, the Montana countryside, and production stills instead of intimate photos with her husband, Kyle Baugher. Interestingly enough, her post with Baugher in 2022 garnered more likes on Instagram than almost any other post the actor has made.</p><p>This includes a picture Reilly took with costar&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Costner</a>&nbsp;in 2020 that only attracted 35,000 like compared to the 83,000 likes with Baugher.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-is-very-private-and-kelly-reilly-does-not-speak-about-him-in-interviews><strong>THE COUPLE IS VERY PRIVATE AND KELLY REILLY DOES NOT SPEAK ABOUT HIM IN INTERVIEWS</strong></h3><p>Very little is known about Kyle Baugher as opposed to his wife, Kelly Reilly, who often finds herself in the spotlight while starring in high-profile projects. Reilly came to the American public’s attention with a supporting role in the 2012 drama&nbsp;Flight&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Denzel Washington</a>. She had made her way through British television with appearances in the&nbsp;Prime Suspect&nbsp;series before heading off to make movies.</p><p>But, the actor has been working on television and in film since the mid-1990s, costarring in&nbsp;Russian Dolls,&nbsp;The Libertine, the 2005 adaptation of&nbsp;Pride & Prejudice,&nbsp;Mrs. Henderson Presents, and Robert Downey Jr.’s&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicki Swift</a>, the latter film and Reilly’s working relationship with director&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guy Ritchie</a>&nbsp;spawned rumors that she was responsible for Ritchie’s divorce from singer Madonna.</p><p>While the rumors that Kelly Reilly and Guy Ritchie turned out not to be accurate, the damage to Reilly’s reputation forced her to be a bit more guarded regarding divulging information to the media.</p><p>Since Kyle Baugher is not an actor, Reilly has made a point to the press that she won’t speak about their life together when she’s getting interviewed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The List</a>&nbsp;reports that Kyle Baugher has lived and worked in New York for quite some time, having grown up in the state. He graduated from Princeton University in 1998 and has an estimated net worth of around $800,000.</p><p>This educational background and Baugher’s occupation make him a stark contrast to the ranch-hand husband Rip Wheeler (Cole Hauser), who occupies much of Beth Dutton’s (Kelly Reilly) marital bliss in&nbsp;Yellowstone.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-reilly-is-currently-starring-in-yellowstone><strong>KELLY REILLY IS CURRENTLY STARRING IN YELLOWSTONE</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kelly-reilly-yellowstone-900x600.jpg><p>Kyle Baugher seems to be continuing his career as a financier while supporting his wife, Kelly Reilly, any chance he gets. While the two rarely appear together on red carpets or in sit-down interviews, it’s clear that their happy marriage contributes to the support Reilly achieves in her acting roles.</p><p>Kelly Reilly is currently starring in the fifth season of&nbsp;Yellowstone, part of creator Taylor Sheridan’s work for Paramount that includes franchise titles like&nbsp;1883&nbsp;and&nbsp;1923.</p><p>As the former star of&nbsp;True Detective&nbsp;and&nbsp;Above Suspicion, Reilly is well-versed in acting for television. The remaining episodes of the fifth season of&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;should return this summer, just in time for the world to witness more of what Reilly has in store for audiences.</p><p>Aside from her work on&nbsp;Yellowstone, Kelly Reilly will be a part of the ensemble cast of director Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of Agatha Christie’s mystery thriller,&nbsp;A Haunting in Venice. She is set to star alongside Jamie Dornan, Tina Fey, <a href=#>Michelle Yeoh</a>, and Jude Hill. Filming is currently taking place between Venice, Italy, and England, so Reilly and her husband, Kyle Baugher, get a chance to spend some time in Europe while filming.</p><p>Next on the agenda for Kelly Reilly is director Robert Zemeckis’ production of&nbsp;Here, diving into the sordid past of one single room and the many inhabitants from the past and future.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&nbsp;will costar Tom Hanks, Paul Bettany, and Robin Wright, based on the novel of the same name by Richard McGuire. This will be another time Reilly has starred in a film directed by Robert Zemeckis after&nbsp;Flight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnm665pnnBmqygoJWne6nAzKU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkyle-baugher-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkyle-baugher-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkyle-baugher-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkyle-baugher-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkyle-baugher-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkyle-baugher-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-mandoline-slicer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-mandoline-slicer.html>The 4 Best Mandoline Slicers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./franoishenri-pinault-wife.html>Franois-Henri Pinault Wife, Net Worth, Age, Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./franoishenri-pinault-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
