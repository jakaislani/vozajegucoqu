It is also known as the Reed and Prince screw drive and is designated as ANSI Type II Cross Recess. It is similar to a Phillips screw drive, but has a sharp tip and a greater angle in the V shape. One benefit of the Phillips drive over other screwdrivers is that a single driver or bit may be used for all screw sizes.

On the basis of affordability, A100 is an excellent exterior paint to apply (although I was getting a 20-40 percent discount at the time). The most significant difference between A100 and duration is that duration may be applied two layers thick (7 mil) before it starts to flow.

解散後にも、イザムさんとアオイさんの名前は、
ちょいちょい耳に入ったりしてましたが、
ベースのNIYさんに限っては、なかなか名前を聞きませんでした。
再結成までにNIYさんは、
どのような人生を歩んでいたのでしょうか？
数年前にNIYさんらの体験談をもとに、
バンドの成功と転落を描いた話が話題となりました。
その時に、NIYさんがインディーズ時代から交際し、
結婚し、最後には離婚した嫁さんと、
その間に生まれた子供の話すがエグすぎすると・・・。
シャズナの全盛期から転落までの間、
結婚していた嫁さんは、どのような方だったのでしょうか？
NIY(SHAZNA・ベース)の現在。結婚して離婚した嫁と子供 NIYさんはインディーズ時代から、
一般人の女性と交際していたそうです。
当時からファンの間では、
NIYさんの彼女がライブハウスのどこからにいると、
かなり敵意を持って探していたそうです・・・そりゃバンギャ相手には危ないですね。。笑
そしてメジャーデビュー前の１９９４年に、
その一般人の女性とNIYさんはついに結婚を果たしました。
シャズナがメジャーでヒットし、
金銭的に豊かだった時代は幸せだったみたいですが、
次第に楽曲の売れ上げが落ち始めの、
バンド活動も休止に入った時代には、
地獄を見たそうです。
ベースのＮＩＹは結婚、離婚を初めて告白した。デビュー前の９４年に一般人の女性と結婚し、１男をもうけた。２０００年１０月のバンド休止後に生活が激変したことで家庭が崩壊。絶頂期から始まった妻の“通販生活”はとどまるところがなく、ついには貯金も底をつき、さらには小学校低学年になった長男が万引きの常習になった。
ＮＩＹは生活費に困り、コンビニの深夜バイトで生計を立てていたが、夫婦生活は修復困難な状況となり、０４年に離婚に至ったという。父として夫として、家庭の変化に「全く気付くことはなかった」とエッセーの中で後悔の念をつづっている。
ＮＩＹ以外の２人も、デビュー前はお笑いコンビ「麒麟」の田村裕の「ホームレス中学生」ばりの極貧生活を送っていたようで、数十万円のローンが払えず、３人ともブラックリスト入りしたことも。ＩＺＡＭは家賃が払えず、車中生活を送ることもあったという。
引用元：https://ameblo.jp/homeless-t/entry-10153427498.html
当時、世間では通販が流行っていましたが、
NIYさんの嫁さは、その全盛期の待った中で、
まさに通販狂に陥ってしまったそうです。
吸入が減り始めても嫁さんの浪費癖は抜けず、
最終的には子供が万引きに走るほど悲惨な家庭になってしまったそうです。
貯金も使い果たし、コンビニの深夜バイトを始めて生計を立てていたというから驚き、
シャズナのベーシストが、まさかコンビニのレジに立ってるなんて、誰も想像もできませんよね。
２００４年に１０年間続いた結婚生活しに終止符を打ったようですが、
親権は嫁さん側にあるため、その後の息子がどのような子に育ったのか・・・怖いですね。
おそらく、息子さんは既に成人してると思うのですが、
現在、親子で会うことはあるのでしょうか？
シャズナ再結成が決まった、
このまま下克上人生を歩んで欲しいですが、
特にNIYさんには新しい家庭が望まれます。
イザムさんもアオイさんも嫁さんと子供には恵まれているので、
一人だけ置いてきぼりは悲しいので・・・。
NIY(SHAZNA・ベース)の舞台俳優としての姿 NIYさんはシャズナが解散した後も、
他で組んだバンド活動をしていたそうですが、
そのバンドはかなり昔に解散しているそうです。
今のNIYさんは主に、
舞台俳優として活動されており、
少し前には映画にてゾンビ役で出演したことで話題になりました。
本作は、ロックを愛する女性・カンナ（渡辺）と、ヘヴィメタを聴くとヘッドバンギングをはじめる不思議なゾンビ・テツオ（NIY）が組んだバンド「HANAJI」の姿を通してバンドマンの葛藤（かっとう）や夢を追う厳しさを描いた、異色の青春映画。この日の試写会では渡辺に加え、「HANAJI」メンバーを演じるGacharic Spinも出演してパフォーマンスが披露された。引用元：https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0061005
メタルを聴くとヘドバンするゾンビ・・・可愛いですね！笑
元バンドマンとしての抜擢だったと思いますが、
その映画から数年後に、シャズナが復活するとは、
誰も夢にも思ってなかったでしょうね！笑
現在のNIYさんは劇団に所属しており、
俳優の仕事に専念していたそうです。
シャズナの元メンバーには全然会ってなかったようで、
今、再結成して、再び戦友たちと全国を回れるのを嬉しく思っていることでしょう！
また活動休止後のメンバーとの交流については「IZAMともほかのメンバーとも、もう随分会ってないです。同じ業界にいるんだし、いつかどこかで接点ができて会えるんじゃないかなとは思っていますが」と語ったNIY。現在のIZAMの活動も「頑張っていると思います。彼は今、自分の劇団を持っているのですが、僕は僕で劇団に所属して俳優をしているので、負けられないって気持ちがあります」と良い刺激になっているようで、バンドの再結成についても「僕自身の参加は考えてないです。俳優としてもっと頑張っていかないといけないですから」と答えるなど、しっかりと先を見据えていた。（取材・文名鹿祥史）引用元：https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0061005
しかし、数年前には再結成への参加に対して否定的に声を出しているので、
今回のNIYさんの参加は、イザムさんなり誰かしらの説得があったのでしょうか？

The rear curvature of your contact lens is indicated by the letter ‘BC,’ which stands for base curve measurement in millimetres. Additionally, your contact lenses will be less prone to fall out as a result of this. A lower BC value indicates that your cornea has a sharper curvature (the clear front surface of your eye).

Green blueberries are not often consumed uncooked; instead, they are frequently cooked or pickled in some form. They may be used to produce a verjus, also known as verjuice, which is typically prepared from unripened grapes that were harvested in order to thin the vines before harvest. If you’re making dressings or marinades, verjus may be used as a replacement for vinegar or citrus juice.
