Alex Honnold is well renowned for being the only person to successfully free solo climb El Capitan and is widely regarded as one of the top rock climbers in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Alex Honnold?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Alex Honnold </a>was born on August 17, 1985, in Sacramento, CA. Both of his parents were community college lecturers. His father’s background is German, and his mother’s is Polish. He started rock climbing at a gym when he was five years old and demonstrated his dedication to the sport by the age of ten, when he was going several times a week.</p><p>He won many rock climbing competitions as a teenager. He attended Mira Loma High School and, after graduating in 2003, enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to study civil engineering. His first year of college proved difficult for him.</p><p>Instead of residing in the dorms, he rented an apartment from a family acquaintance, which resulted in him making few friends. In addition to being secluded during his freshman year, his parents were divorcing, and his grandma died. He routinely missed courses, and after taking a semester off to train for the National Climbing Championships in Scotland, he did not return to school.</p><p>After finishing school, he spent time climbing and driving around California in his mother’s minivan. After the minivan broke down, he rode a bicycle and tented in a tent. He claims that he lived on less than $1,000 per month from 2004 to 2009.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Alex Honnold?</h2><p>He is currently 38 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Alex Honnold’s net worth?</h2><p>He is estimated to be worth $2 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Alex Honnold’s career?</h2><p>Although he had competed in climbing contests for much of his life, he was virtually obscure even within the climbing world until roughly 2007. In that year, he free soloed Yosemite Valley’s Astroman and Rostrum in a single day, a feat only surpassed by climber Peter Croft in 1987.</p><p>Only after this accomplishment did he earn broad notoriety among the climbing world. The following year, he free soloed a 1,200-foot-tall finger crack that splits Zion’s Moonlight Buttress, and when this accomplishment was published, many people assumed it was a prank due to the great difficulty of the climb and the date of the news (April 1st).</p><p>Later in 2008, Honnold free soloed Half Dome’s 2,000-foot Regular Northwest Face in Yosemite, and in 2012, he set a new record for fastest ascent at one hour and twenty-two minutes. By 2009, he had gained some recognition in the climbing world and signed a three-year contract, but he was still largely unknown to the general public. In 2010, he got the Golden Piton Award for endurance rock climbing.</p><p>In 2011, he was known as one of the world’s most accomplished free solo rock climbers, and he was gaining attention outside of the climbing community. In May 2011, he was featured on the cover of National Geographic, and in the winter of that year, he attempted to break the record for the fastest climb of El Capitan but fell short by only 45 seconds.</p><p>He achieved popular fame in 2012 after appearing on “60 Minutes” to discuss his free solo climb of Half Dome’s Regular Northwest Face, as well as being included in the documentary climbing film “Alone on the Wall.” In June of that year, he and fellow climber Hans Florine again attempted to break the record for fastest ascent of El Capitan, and they were successful, setting a new record of 2 hours, 23 minutes, and 46 seconds.</p><p>In 2014, Honnold and several other climbers were featured in the documentary “Valley Uprising,” about the evolution of rock climbing in Yosemite Park, and Cliff Bar was one of the film’s financial sponsors, as well as having sponsorship relationships with five of the climbers in the film, including Honnold.</p><p>However, a few months after the film’s debut, Cliff Bar terminated sponsorship agreements with the featured professional climbers. They indicated that they chose to do so because the corporation was uncomfortable with how far the climbers were pushing the sport’s boundaries and was concerned that they were taking excessive risks. Honnold is well-known for taking enormous risks with a seemingly carefree attitude for his own life and safety.</p><p>On June 3rd, 2017, Honnold achieved the first free solo ascent of El Capitan via the 2,900-foot Freerider route. He finished the ascent in 3 hours and 56 minutes, and it has been hailed as one of the most amazing athletic accomplishments ever. It was documented by climber and photographer Jimmy Chin and his wife, documentary filmmaker Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who published the documentary film “Free Solo” in 2018. It received the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqjnrBdnbyvus6lm2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-honnold.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falex-honnold.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falex-honnold.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falex-honnold.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-honnold.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-honnold.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bubby-brister-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bubby-brister-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>Bubby Brister Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./a-philip-randolph.html>A.
