A mathematics prodigy who attended Harvard University, Kaczynski taught at the University of California at Berkeley before retreating to a survivalist lifestyle in the Montana woods. Kaczynski mailed a series of bombs to universities and airlines and, in 1995, wrote a 35,000-word manifesto on what he believed were problems of modern society. FBI agents arrested Kaczynski in 1996, and two years later, he was sentenced to life in prison. Kaczynski died by apparent suicide at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina, in June 2023.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Theodore John Kaczynski<br>BORN: May 22, 1942<br>DIED: June 10, 2023<br>BIRTHPLACE: Chicago, Illinois<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Gemini</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Theodore John Kaczynski was born on May 22, 1942, in Chicago, the oldest child of a Polish-American couple, Wanda and Theodore. As a baby, Kaczynski had an allergic reaction to some medication and spent time in isolation while recovering. Some reports indicate that he had a noticeable change in personality after being hospitalized. The arrival of his younger brother, David, also allegedly had a strong effect on him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When he was a child, the family moved out of the city to Evergreen Park, a suburb of Chicago. Kaczynski’s parents pushed him hard to achieve academic success. A bright child, Kaczynski skipped two grades during his early education. However, he was smaller than the other kids and regarded as “different” because of his intelligence. Still, Kaczynski was active in school groups, including the German and chess clubs.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Higher Education" data-anchor-id=higher-education class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Higher Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1958, at the age of 16, Kaczynski entered Harvard University on a scholarship. There, he studied mathematics and was part of a psychological experiment conducted by professor Henry A. Murray, in which participants were subjected to extensive verbal abuse. This experiment, too, is thought to have been a factor in Kaczynski’s later behavior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from Harvard in 1962, Kaczynski continued his studies at the University of Michigan. While there, he taught classes and worked on his dissertation, which was widely praised. Kaczynski earned his doctorate degree from the university in 1967 then moved west to teach at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, Kaczynski struggled at Berkeley, as he had a hard time delivering his lectures and often avoided contact with his students. He suddenly resigned from his assistant professorship in 1969.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title=Cabin data-anchor-id=cabin class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Cabin</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the early 1970s, Kaczynski had given up his old life and settled in Montana. He built himself a small cabin near Lincoln, where he lived in near-total isolation, hunting rabbits, growing vegetables, and spending much of his time reading. While living this remote, survivalist lifestyle, Kaczynski developed his own anti-government and anti-technology philosophy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1978, Kaczynski moved back to Chicago to work in the same factory as his brother. While there, he had a relationship with a female supervisor, but eventually, it turned sour. In retaliation, Kaczynski wrote crude limericks about her, resulting in his dismissal from the company. His brother, David, was also a supervisor and the one that had to break the news to Ted.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 title="The Unabomber Emerges" data-anchor-id=the-unabomber-emerges class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">The Unabomber Emerges</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also in 1978, Kaczynski left a homemade bomb in a package at the University of Chicago, with a return address for a Northwestern University professor. The package was forwarded to Northwestern and opened by a campus security officer, who sustained minor injuries when the bomb exploded. Another bomb was sent to the same university the following year, but by this time, Kaczynski had returned to Montana.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kaczynski then targeted American airline companies with two bombs: one in 1979 that failed to detonate on an American Airlines flight and one in 1980 that was sent to the president of United Airlines, who sustained minor injuries after it exploded. Working with the U.S. Postal Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the FBI started a task force to look into these mysterious attacks. The case was known by the acronym UNABOM, which stood for University and Airline Bombing. Eventually, the unknown assailant came to be known as the Unabomber.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1982, Kaczynski’s bombs were more destructive: That year, a secretary at Vanderbilt University and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley both sustained serious injuries from Kaczynski’s explosive packages. The first fatality came in December 1985, when a computer store owner was killed by a device outside his shop. Over the next decade, Kaczynski’s bombs would result in two more deaths and additional injuries.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Infamous Domestic Terrorists</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=23 title="Manifesto and Arrest" data-anchor-id=manifesto-and-arrest class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Manifesto and Arrest</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The big break in the case came in 1995 when Kaczynski sent out a 35,000-word essay on the problems of modern society. He even threatened media outlets, such as The New York Times, to publish his so-called “Unabomber Manifesto,” telling them he would blow up a plane if they failed to do so. The manifesto, titled Industrial Society and Its Future, was first published in September 1995.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly thereafter, Kaczynski’s sister-in-law, Linda Patrik, read the manifesto and encouraged her husband to do so, as well. Although he and Ted had become estranged over the years, David recognized the writing style and some of the ideas expressed as his brother’s. After consulting with a private detective, in early 1996, David shared his suspicions with the FBI.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On April 3, 1996, federal investigators arrested Kaczynski at his cabin in Montana. News outlets carried images of the bearded and disheveled Kaczynski, giving the country and the world its first glimpse of the infamous Unabomber. At his cabin, they found one completed bomb, other bomb parts, and about 40,000 pages of his journals, in which he described his crimes in detail.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 title="Life Behind Bars" data-anchor-id=life-behind-bars class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Life Behind Bars</h2><img alt="ted kaczynski talking while sitting behind a glass wall" title="Ted Kaczynski gives an interview at a Florence, Colorado, supermax prison" width=1024 height=716 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-domestic-terrorist-luddite-and-mathematics-teacher-news-photo-1686589400.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Ted Kaczynski speaks during an interview at a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, in August 1999.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In January 1998, Kaczynski attempted suicide as he prepared to go on trial. He insisted his lawyers not use any type of insanity defense, and he rejected any implication that he was mentally ill. However, after a failed bid to represent himself in court, Kaczynski decided to plead guilty to 13 bombing-related charges in federal court. In return, the government agreed to forego the pursuit of the death penalty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 1998, Kaczynski was sentenced to prison for life for his actions. He was sent to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative-Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, where, for a time, he was housed in the same unit as Oklahoma City bomber <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/timothy-mcveigh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Timothy McVeigh" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Timothy McVeigh</a> and World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Ahmed Yousef.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kaczynski continued his personal battle against federal authority from behind bars. When the government was granted approval to auction off papers taken from his Montana cabin, as a means of providing restitution to victims, Kaczynski appealed on the grounds that his First Amendment rights were being violated. An online auction eventually was held in the spring of 2011.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kaczynski was transferred to the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina—a facility offering treatment for prisoners with serious health problems—in 2021. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/bernard-madoff data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bernie Madoff" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bernie Madoff</a>, who orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/ted-kaczynski-unabomber-1197f597364b36e56bdbcaca9837bdc4 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="also served" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">also served</a> time at the Butner complex and died there in 2021.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 title=Death data-anchor-id=death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kaczynski was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2023/06/10/1181516760/ted-kaczynski-unabomber-dies data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="found unresponsive" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">found unresponsive</a> inside his cell during the early morning of June 10, 2023.
