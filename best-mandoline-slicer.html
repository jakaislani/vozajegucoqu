As a recipe developer, cookbook author, and avid home cook, I’ve used one for years. I reach for my mandoline anytime I want to make a <a href=#>shaved fennel salad</a>, homemade <a href=#>coleslaw</a>, or other dish that’s best with paper-thin slices of veggies. Consisting of a flat surface fitted with an adjustable blade, it helps me cut them quickly and consistently, no fancy knife skills required.</p><p>I’d recommend a mandoline slicer to any cook (especially a vegetable lover!), with the caveat that you have to watch your fingers near the sharp blade. I recently tested and reviewed the best mandoline slicers to help you get a sense of different mandoline styles, learn what to look for in a mandoline, and ultimately choose the right one for you.

I’m not its only fan—it’s also beloved by restaurant chefs, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Epicurious</a>&nbsp;named it one of the best mandoline slicers.</p><p>This Japanese mandoline has an ultra-sharp stainless steel blade that effortlessly slices through everything from thin-skinned cucumbers to tough carrots. Mine has retained its sharp edge after years of use, but if it dulls in the future, I can order a replacement blade. While most other mandolines I tested had thicknesses presets, this model is easy to adjust to any thickness using a dial on the back. I like that it gives me complete control over the width of my slices.</p><p>In addition to the straight blade, the Benriner mandoline comes with 3 julienne blades—a coarse, medium, and narrow. They make this slicer a versatile kitchen tool.</p><p>Other reasons I love it? The compact size makes it easy to stash in a drawer, and the rubber base helps it grip the counter or a cutting board as you slice.</p><p>The only downside of this model is that the guard doesn’t grasp vegetables securely, which makes it a less safe option than others. I recommend using it with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cut resistant glove</a> instead.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$54.99 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 12.8 by 3.63 by 1.2 inches</li><li>Weight: 15.2 ounces</li><li>Material: BPA-free plastic with stainless steel blades</li><li>Dishwasher Safe: No</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Small size makes it easy to store</li><li>Blade stays sharp for years and can be replaced</li><li>Easy to adjust cutting thickness with dial</li><li>Rubber base provides stability</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>The guard is difficult to use</li></ul><p><strong>Buy the Benriner No. 64 Mandoline:</strong></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$40.70 at Amazon</a><h2>2. <strong>Best for Beginners:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">OXO Good Grips V-Blade Mandoline Slicer</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-mandoline-slicer/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/oxo-vslice-mandoline.jpg&description=We+tested+and+reviewed+seven+mandoline+slicers+to+find+the+best%21+These+kitchen+tools+quickly+and+efficiently+cut+even%2C+thin+slices+and+are+great+for+making+potato+gratins%2C+coleslaw%2C+and+more.")'></span></span></p><p>I think this OXO V-Blade Mandoline is the best mandoline slicer for beginners because of its safety features. Unlike the Benriner handheld mandoline, this slicer has a leg with rubber non-slip feet that folds out from the mandoline’s frame. The leg supports the mandoline on the countertop, offering extra stability as you slice fruits and vegetables. This mandoline also comes with an excellent pronged food holder that firmly grips food and protects your fingers while slicing. It’s the most secure, user-friendly guard I’ve used on a mandoline.</p><p>Other features I liked: The mandoline’s body is dishwasher safe, and it comes with 4 interchangeable blades for julienning and making crinkle cuts. Though its 4 thickness presets are more limiting than the Benriner’s dial, they offer enough range for most recipes.</p><p>For me, the biggest downside of this model is its size. On the bulkier side, it’s too large to store in a drawer. I also found that some of my slices would catch and tear on the V-blade, an issue I didn’t have with other mandolines.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$45.95 at Amazon</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$45.99 at Target</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 6 by 5.5 by 15.5 inches</li><li>Weight: 2.38 pounds</li><li>Material: Plastic with stainless steel blades</li><li>Dishwasher safe: Body is top rack dishwasher safe.

It’s a solid option at a solid price point—$18.99, well below the other models I tried. The big pros of this mandoline are its small size, its stable rubber base, and the fact that it’s dishwasher safe.</p><p>The cons? This mandoline only cuts to 3 thickness settings, and I’ve found that the blade dulls quickly with frequent use. In their review of the best mandoline slicers, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Food Network</a> also noted that it struggled with tough veggies like eggplants and tomatoes. Unfortunately, you’re not able to sharpen or replace the blade, so once it’s dull, the entire gadget becomes less useful (and less safe).</p><p>Overall, this mandoline is a great option for the price, but the Benriner is a better investment if you’re looking for a handheld slicer that will stand the test of time.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18.99 at Amazon</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18.99 at Target</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 3.75 by .5 by 11.5 inches</li><li>Weight: 8.8 ounces</li><li>Material: BPA-free plastic with stainless steel blade</li><li>Dishwasher Safe: Yes</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Great price point</li><li>Small size makes it easy to store</li><li>Rubber base provides stability</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Blade dulls more quickly than others</li><li>Includes only 1 blade style, no interchangeable options</li><li>Limited to 3 thickness presets</li></ul><p><strong>Buy the OXO Good Grips Handheld Mandoline Slicer:</strong></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18.99 at Amazon</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18.99 at Target</a><h2><strong>4.

The compact set includes a slicing blade, coarse grater, and medium grater that all tuck into an 8 by 3-inch storage case. Each attachment fits over the case’s lid, so it can double as a container for catching veggie slices. I love that this set is dishwasher-safe for easy cleanup.</p><p>Downsides of this option are that the slicing blade is not adjustable, so it only cuts to one thickness. And because of its small size, it’s better suited to cutting cucumbers and radishes than larger produce like cabbage and potatoes. If you’re an advanced cook looking for a true mandoline, I recommend the Benriner or OXO V-Blade options above. But for beginners working in a tight kitchen, this set could be a great, versatile choice.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22.95 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 8 by 3.25 by 3.5 inches</li><li>Weight: 15.5 ounces</li><li>Material: BPA-free plastic</li><li>Dishwasher safe: Yes</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Compact size is ideal for those with limited storage space</li><li>Multiple uses</li><li>Storage lid doubles as container to catch vegetable slices</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Small cutting surface</li><li>Slicing thickness not adjustable</li></ul><p><strong>Buy the OXO Good Grips Mini Complete Grate & Slice Set:</strong></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22.95 at Amazon</a><h2>Other Mandolines We Tested</h2><h2><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DASH Safe Slice Mandoline</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-mandoline-slicer/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dash-mandoline-slicer.jpg&description=We+tested+and+reviewed+seven+mandoline+slicers+to+find+the+best%21+These+kitchen+tools+quickly+and+efficiently+cut+even%2C+thin+slices+and+are+great+for+making+potato+gratins%2C+coleslaw%2C+and+more.")'></span></span></p><p>The big benefit of the DASH Safe Slice Mandoline Slicer is that your fingers don’t come anywhere near the blade. This mandoline stands nearly vertically on the countertop, and you use a plastic ingredient pusher to press fruits and veggies down a chute towards the blade. To slice, you press a spring-loaded knob at the top.</p><p>The DASH cuts really clean, even slices, and the thickness is easy to adjust with a dial at the back. It can also julienne, dice, or cut large matchsticks for French fries.</p><p>Though it was by far the safest model I tried, I felt that it was a little too clunky to store and set up for everyday use. The chute design also makes it harder to clean than other models, and it limits the sizes and shapes of vegetables you can slice.</p><p>However, if you don’t want to risk cutting your fingers, the DASH could be the best mandoline slicer for you. It has a 4.5-star average from 20,700 reviews on Amazon, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Food Network</a> chose it as the Best Mandoline for Beginners.</p><p><strong>Buy the DASH Safe Slice Mandoline:</strong></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$47.08 at Amazon</a><h2><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kyocera Advanced Ceramic Double-Edged Mandoline Slicer</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-mandoline-slicer/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kyocera-soft-grip.jpg&description=We+tested+and+reviewed+seven+mandoline+slicers+to+find+the+best%21+These+kitchen+tools+quickly+and+efficiently+cut+even%2C+thin+slices+and+are+great+for+making+potato+gratins%2C+coleslaw%2C+and+more.")'></span></span></p><p>This Kyocera mandoline slicer is well-reviewed by other sites, so I expected to like it more than I did.

When I tested these mandolines, I evaluated them on four criteria. I recommend you consider these same factors when you shop:</p><h4>Safety</h4><p>The risk of a mandoline slicer is that you’re bringing your hand towards the blade as you slice. I speak from experience when I tell you that it’s very easy to cut yourself on one. To protect yourself, always pay attention when you’re using a mandoline, and don’t hesitate to leave some vegetable intact between the blade and your fingers.</p><p>Some models also have built-in safety features. Many have plastic hand guards that clamp onto vegetables, separating your fingers from the blade. Guards vary widely in stability and usability. I was most impressed with the OXO V-Blade food holder.</p><p>A good alternative to a guard is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cut resistant glove</a>, which I now use with my Benriner mandoline. These are durable, affordable, and machine washable, and they’ve saved my fingers more than once. I definitely recommend a pair!</p><p>If safety is your #1 priority, you may also like the DASH Safe Slice Mandoline (see above). Its unique design is by far the safest I’ve seen.</p><h4>Ease of Use</h4><p>If your mandoline is a hassle to get out and set up, you’re not going to use it much. Ideally, it won’t feel much harder to use (or to clean) than a chef’s knife.</p><h4>Style and Size</h4><p>I tested both handheld and countertop slicers for this post. I personally like the small size and simplicity of a handheld one, but countertop models have the benefit of being more stable and potentially safer.</p><h4>Price and Durability</h4><p>Will your mandoline hold up with repeated use? If the blade dulls, can you sharpen or replace it? Is the use you’ll get out of it worth the price?</p><h2>How We Tested</h2><p>To find the best mandoline slicer, I selected seven models to test. I chose slicers that have been highly reviewed online, that have been recommended to me by other recipe developers, or that I had personal experience using.</p><p>I used each slicer to cut potatoes for a gratin, to thinly slice apples, and to shave fennel for a salad. When they were an option, I experimented with julienne, dice, and French fry cuts, and I made sure to test out a range of thicknesses, evaluating how easy each mandoline was to adjust.</p><p>Overall, I recommend the Benriner Classic Mandoline for its exceptional ease of use, small size, and durability. I’ve owned and loved mine for years! Just make sure to protect your digits with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cut resistant glove.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfl7K0wIymmKecn6G2r7GMrKOim5WnfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-mandoline-slicer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-mandoline-slicer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-mandoline-slicer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-mandoline-slicer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-mandoline-slicer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-mandoline-slicer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./graphic-artist-and-designer-frank-kozik-died-at-61.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./graphic-artist-and-designer-frank-kozik-died-at-61.html>Graphic Artist And Designer Frank Kozik Died At 61: Cause Of Death, Obituary And More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kyle-baugher-html.html>Kyle Baugher: Who Is Kelly Reillys Husband?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kyle-baugher-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
