Several tall candles sit on the table and border a large vase filled with tall dark branches, and a vintage Parisian light fixture overlooks the setting.</p><p>Kardashian then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made her way to her kitchen</a>, which features two large islands with white tabletops. One of the islands contains gray cabinets while the other is hollowed out with bar stools.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>The chef’s kitchen includes pretty much everything one could need for making food, including stainless steel ovens, a stainless steel refrigerator and an antique kitchen table with chairs for her and her family to enjoy the gluten-free goodies.</p><p>Kardashian decorated the room with black skulls in her cabinets, <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>a $1,500 Kelly Wearstler pop bowl</a> sister Khloé Kardashian gave her, black-and-white photographs and, of course, her children’s artwork on display.</p><p>The reality star, who shares daughter Penelope and sons Mason and Reign with ex Scott Disick, said they only use their living room for “special occasions” as she took viewers in for a look.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Kardashian’s living room features white couches, gray chairs and a black piano. <span class=credit>Architectual Digest/YouTube</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">She put up a Christmas tree in her living room for the holidays. <span class=credit>kourtneykardash</span></figure><p>The room is centered around a blackwood coffee table, and white wool sofas and two gray leather square chairs surround the piece that all face the limestone fireplace.</p><p>Kardashian — who also shares son Rocky with husband Travis Barker — has several special touches that make the space unique, such as her childhood black Yamaha piano, vintage bronze lamps, a pool table and pink roses always in the middle on the coffee table.</p><p>For even more special occasions, Kardashian has a dining room with a large rectangular wooden table with matching chairs. Similar to many of her rooms, the dining area has a large green potted plant in the corner.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The reality TV star also has a long wooden dining room they use for special occasions, such as Christmas. <span class=credit>kourtneykardash</span></figure><p>Kardashian has black-and-white photography decorating her office, with several professional portraits and photos are hung in black frames. Her desk is L-shaped and dark brown wood for half of it and a clear glass circle for the other side.</p><p>All of the downstairs rooms overlook her sprawling backyard, which features several different kinds of trees, flowers and shrubs and a rectangular pool with a wooden cabana. The yard is also equipped with an outdoor fire pit and a roofed dining area.</p><p>As for the upstairs section of the house, the floors are all dark mahogany wooden floors with a black steel fence over the sides. Several pieces of colorful artwork are hung on the hallway’s cream-colored walls.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Kardashian’s backyard includes a pool, a cabana and lots of greenery. <span class=credit>kourtneykardash/Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The mom of four has a backyard area with a roof over it, so guests can enjoy a mix of indoors and outdoors. <span class=credit>kourtneykardash/Instagram</span></figure><p>The upstairs primary and guest bedrooms all have similar cream walls and light-colored furniture with accents of black decor –– like black rugs, black lamps, black picture frames and black framed mirrors.</p><p>The mom of four’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">primary bedroom</a> is classic and simple with a cream rug, cream bed, white sheets, white curtains, beige walls, a fireplace built into the front wall and a black table with a circular glass top.</p><p>Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">primary bathroom</a> matches the feel of the bedrooms, with light-colored and black accessories. One bathroom in particular has a white tub, white sink, cream floors and a cream rug but also features a tall black towel rack and black cabinets under the sink.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Mason, Penelope and Reign Disick all have their own rooms. <span class=credit>kourtneykardash/Instagram</span></figure><p>Kardashian’s wooden and beige <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">walk-in closet</a> is stacked to the brim with shoes, clothing, purses and other accessories.</p><p>While many of Kardashian’s rooms feel similar, her children’s rooms are a bit more colorful.</p><p>Penelope’s room <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has cream walls </a>with a light pink bed frame, a neon pink “love” sign above her bed, a white dresser, a white L-shaped desk, and of course a large walk-in closet with several racks of clothing and shelves of shoes.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The Poosh founder has yet to share a complete photo of her son’s nursery. <span class=credit>kourtneykardash/Instagram</span></figure><p>She also has artwork hung across her room, and one of these is even a large hot pink canvas with a large black skull painted on it. The artwork hangs above where her custom pink drum set sits.</p><p>Mason –– who prefers to <a href=#>stay out of the public eye</a> –– has not shared photographs in his room for several years, but in 2018, Kardashian decorated it in a “Star Wars” theme with constellation wallpaper and bunk beds.</p><p><strong>For more Page Six reality TV updates</strong></p><p>Just like his mom and his sister, Mason also has an impressive walk-in closet, which has five shelves filled with shoes and hats, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">per a January 2023 TikTok video from Penelope.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Reign has a safari-themed room adorned with a silver vintage airplane above his bed, white cabinets on both sides of his bed filled with books and toys and a large plush toy lion and elephant.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Kardashian described the vibe of her house as “really chic but practical.” <span class=credit>Instagram/@kourtneykardash</span></figure><p>Kardashian and her husband, Travis Barker — who as of 2022 lived in separate homes in the same neighborhood but <a href=#>own a joint beachfront home</a> — <a href=#>welcomed their first child together</a>, Rocky, in October 2023.</p><p>They have yet to share a photo of the whole room, but Kardashian <a href=#>shared one snap of a $10,000 maple hardwood paneled crib</a> with a blue stuffed animal sitting on it just days before she gave birth.</p><p>Kardashian’s three oldest children split their time with her and ex-boyfriend, Scott Disick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e8inqqKclWK4sMHRraWesV2grrOwwKyfopmeYrWwwdKeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-kourtney-kardashian-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-kourtney-kardashian-house.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-kourtney-kardashian-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-kourtney-kardashian-house.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-kourtney-kardashian-house.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-kourtney-kardashian-house.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lisa-mantler.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lisa-mantler.html>Lisa Mantler- Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./debra-lynn-godfrey.html>American Golf Player, Debra Lynn Godfrey &amp;amp; Roger Clemens Recently Celebrated Their 38th Marriage Ann</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./debra-lynn-godfrey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
